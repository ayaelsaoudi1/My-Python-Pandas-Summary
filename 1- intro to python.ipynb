    "# **Introduction to Python**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To communicate a real-life problem to a computer, you need to write a specific type of text called **source code** (or **human-readable code**). This code is processed and converted into binary (0s and 1s) that the computer can understand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is a Program?**  \n",
    "- A **program** is a sequence of instructions that tell the computer how to perform a computation.  \n",
    "- **Programming** is the process of translating a task into a programming language that the computer can execute.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Computer Science vs. Programming**  \n",
    "- **Computer Science** focuses on understanding what computers can do.  \n",
    "- **Programming** is the practice of instructing computers to perform specific tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Aspects of Programming**  \n",
    "- Formulating problems.  \n",
    "- Breaking them down into **logical steps**.  \n",
    "- Writing clear, structured instructions that the computer can execute.  \n",

    "   - Understand the problem and break it down into a **sequence of computational steps**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mechanistic Thinking**  \n",
    "   - Computers **only execute what they are told**, so precise instructions are crucial.  \n",
    "   - A solid understanding of **syntax and logic** is essential.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Writing Clean and Efficient Code**  \n",
    "   - Follow best practices for readability and maintainability.  \n",
    "   - Use clear naming conventions, proper indentation, and structured logic.  \n"

    "### Why Python?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open-Source & Free:** Python is constantly updated and maintained by a large community, ensuring its reliability and continuous improvement.  \n",
    "- **General-Purpose:** Python is highly versatile, making it suitable for data analysis, web development, automation, artificial intelligence, and more.  \n",
    "- **High-Level Language:** Unlike low-level languages (machine languages), which are difficult to code and understand, Python employs a syntax that closely resembles human logic. This makes it easier to learn, write, and maintain, allowing developers to focus on problem-solving rather than deciphering complex code.  \n",
    "- **Practical Applications:** Python provides the flexibility to work with **big data**, enabling efficient data processing, analytics, and visualization."

    "**Jupyter is a server-client application** that allows you to write, edit, and execute code directly from a web browser.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Jupyter **server** provides the computing environment, while the **client interfaces** (such as web browsers) interact with language **kernels** (e.g., Python).  \n",
    "- Your work is stored in a **notebook document**. Since we are using Python, the files are called **IPython Notebook files** with the **.ipynb** extension.  \n",
    "- Jupyter offers a **user-friendly environment** that seamlessly integrates **code execution, data visualization, and documentation** within a single interface.  \n",
    "- It is **free and open-source**, making it widely accessible for data scientists, researchers, and developers."
