    "# **Fundamentals of OOP and Modules in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Objects in Python**  \n",
    "- **Everything in Python is an object**: From integers, floats, strings, lists, to more complex data structures.  \n",
    "- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** allows us to model real-world entities through **objects**, which combine **data** and **methods** to perform actions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Classes and Objects**  \n",
    "- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes and behaviors.  \n",
    "- **Object**: An instance of a class, containing specific data.  \n",
    "- **Attributes**: Characteristics that describe an object (e.g., color, size).  \n",
    "- **Methods**: Actions or operations that an object can perform (e.g., turning left, accelerating).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Example: Bicycle**  \n",
    "- **Class**: `BikeMaker` defines how to create bikes.  \n",
    "- **Object**: A bike is an instance of the `BikeMaker` class.  \n",
    "- **Attributes**: `color`, `size`, `type` of bike.  \n",
    "- **Methods**: `.turn_left()`, `.slow_down()` represent bike actions.  \n",
    "- **OOP vs. Procedural Programming**: OOP focuses on **objects** and their interactions, whereas procedural programming focuses on **functions** and **actions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Example in Python**  \n",
    "- **Object**: A list of numbers `[3.5, 5.1, 44.0]`.  \n",
    "- **Attributes**: Data type (`float`).  \n",
    "- **Methods**: `.extend()`, `.index()` are operations on the list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Function vs. Method**  \n",
    "| **Function**  | **Method**  |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------|\n",
    "| Defined independently | Associated with a class |\n",
    "| Can take multiple parameters | The object itself is an implicit parameter |\n",
    "| Called as `function()` | Called as `object.method()` |\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Modules and Packages in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. What is a Module?**  \n",
    "- A **module** is a file containing Python code—such as variables, functions, and classes—that can be reused in other Python programs.  \n",
    "- Modules help improve **code reusability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. What is a Package?**  \n",
    "- A **package** is a collection of related modules, often organized in directories.  \n",
    "- **Pre-built packages** are available, like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas`.  \n",
    "- A **library** can sometimes be considered synonymous with a package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Python’s Standard Library**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. What is the Standard Library?**  \n",
    "- A set of built-in modules that come with Python installation.  \n",
    "- Example: `len()` function, `math` module, `list` class.  \n",
    "- These modules are available without additional installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Practical Use of Python Modules**  \n",
    "- **Standard library modules** don’t require manual installation.  \n",
    "- **Additional modules** can be installed using `pip`.  \n",
    "- **Reuse existing modules** instead of creating new ones to save time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Importing Modules in Python**\n",
